### About Me

I'm a young, stupid, dumb web developer who composes bad techno (nobody listens to techno!)
and draws stuff. I also make video "games" in Unity.

<br>

I have no idea how this whole "being on the internet" thing works, so if you'd like to let
me in on a little secret you can e-mail me (mailto:glitchyneopet@gmail.com)[here.]

### More Pages

This site isn't only bullet points about me, it's multiple pages of bullet points about me!
